# odin-landing
I'm going to take this landing page section by section. Where I'll write the html to get the content on the page and then styling the page with css. I'm basically doing what TOP suggested. I plan on getting as close to the design concept as I possibly can and once that's done. Perhaps I'll style the page the way I want, it's a process right now but I'm hoping for good things.
